reprepro

This is the reprepro module.

Usage:

  include reprepro

  reprepro::repository{
    'local':
      owner  => 'root', # default
      group  => 'root', # default
      config => 'reprepro/local.conf.erb';
  }

It will create a local debian repository under /var/www/local.  It
supports an incoming directory in /var/www/local/incoming.  Each time
you run puppet it will run reprepro to process the incoming directory.

This is this work in progress.

You can use the local repository by adding 
deb file:///var/www/local squeeze main contrib non-free
to your sources.list file.
